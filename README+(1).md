## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free, modelling is done using Linear regression to understand which variables are significant in predicting demand for sales
- Data set used: day.csv provided by Upgrad


## Conclusions
1. As per our final Model, the top 3 predictor variables that influences the bike booking are:
temp, yr, season_2
2. A unit increase in temp(Temperature) variable increase the bike hire numbers by 0.519176 units. A unit increase in yr(Year) variable increase the bike hire numbers by 0.232250 units.
3. A unit increase in season_2(summer) variable increase the bike hire numbers by 0.101969 units. So it recommended to give maximum consideration to above features to achieve maximum bike rental demand 
4.Next best variables to be considered:
a.workingday - A coefficient value of ‘0.0231’ indicated that a unit increase in workind day variable increases b.bike hire numbers by 0.023135 units.
c.windspeed - A coefficient value of ‘-0.148850’ indicated that a unit increase in windspeed variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.149709 units.¶
